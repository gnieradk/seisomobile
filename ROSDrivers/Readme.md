#Wheels motor driver
The seismob_wheels_driver includes files which can be registered and launched as ROS service. When the service and rosbridge is running the commands could be sended by web application wheels.html.

For motors drivers the 2x [Waveshare Drive HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/motor-driver-hat.htm) are used. Each motor can be setted indepedently of each other. The reason is that the wheels are mecanum so in the near future the full omnidirectional movement could be designed and introduced.
